This year, I'm starting the **Hexcrawl25** challenge, taking inspiration from the awesome [Dungeon23 challenge](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) by Sean McCoy. I've been captivated by projects like this since 2023, and just amazed with all the amazing content developed by the community. Not to mention that there is just something I love about the old school art style for dungeon and world mapping-- in particular how easy it is to pick up even if you aren't a particularly skilled artist.

Full disclosure, I didn't complete the Dungeon23 challenge in 2023, nor when I tried again this year. So when I was thinking about what I might want to do in the upcoming year, I gave a lot of thought to designing something I feel like I might actually complete! Not only that, but I wanted more than a megadungeon by the end-- because why stop there when you can make a whole world?

By the end of this challenge, I hope to have a fully fleshed out campaign setting, complete with my own hand drawn art. I'm hoping that at least a few other people decide to take this challenge up in 2025 with me-- after all, it's not the destination, but rather the friends you make along the way (across the hex map).

Alright enough intro. Here's the challenge! I'll start with a concise, TL;DR version (provided you made it to this point), followed by a more detailed description with images. I'll also include resources at the end of this post that I made myself that might help you along the way, should you decide to join me-- and links to several other resources from other creators that I've found useful.

## Hexcrawl25 Overview

#### Process Summary:

1. **Start the Campaign Level Hex Grid**: Arrange 19 hexes in a flower configuration (a central hex with two surrounding rings). These are **regional hexes** that represent your campaign setting. Suggested scale: 24 miles per regional hex. Flat or pointy top hexes, your choice-- but make these hexes large enough that you can draw several regional features on one hex.

2. **Create Regional Art**: Over the year, design each regional hex with features like mountains, forests, rivers, roads, deserts, or corrupted fields. Add points of interest (e.g., dungeons, villages, towns, cities). Be as creative as you like—this is your campaign setting!

3. **Divide into Sub-Hexes**: Divide each regional hex into 19 **sub-hexes** (using the same hex flower pattern). Suggested scale: 6 miles per sub-hex. 

4. **Worldbuilding in Sub-Hexes**: Populate the 319 sub-hexes with interesting content. Write descriptions of monsters, natural features (e.g., waterfalls, caves), settlements, NPCs, or other notable landmarks.

5. **Avoid Burnout**: Keep the detail level manageable—high-level information is enough. You can expand later, but prioritize finishing the whole map first. Take breaks! There are only 319 hexes, so you have 56 days of margin-- use them!

#### Suggested Progression Plan

There are many ways to plan this out. I do believe it's important to have a plan, though, just to keep track of your progress. Divvy up the work however you like, though, according to your own schedule. I chose this layout myself (and it will probably change), because this works out to writing out a hex every weekday, freeing up weekends, with a lighter load during the end of year holidays. Whatever works for you!

### Hexcrawl25 Detailed Description

The campaign hex map will consist of 19 regional hexes arranged in a flower, alphabetically labeled in a spiral radiating from the center hex.

#### Regional Sub-Hexes and labeling

Each of these regions will consist of sub-hexes that interlock over the regional hexes.

The sub-hexes will be labeled numerically with their regional hex letter. Note that each regional hex shares the 6 edge hexes with its neighbors. These shared edge hexes are labeled by their connected region hex letters, e.g., AG or AB.

Extending this scheme to the edges, we get the following for flat and pointy varieties. Remember! **You do not have to use this scheme... or any indexing scheme!**

##### Flat Index

##### Pointy Index

#### Map Scale

Using OSR conventions, each sub-hex is 6 miles. This means that each regional hex is 24 miles, which provides a nice sized area to fill in a cohesive set of content.

#### Drawing Map Region by Region

For each regional hex, draw map features.

Plan for extension of the map at the hex borders with placeholder draft drawings. Don't fill out the whole map! And even my example might be too detailed. Keep your eye fixed on the next region you plan to build out, and maybe think about some broader features only peripherally.

#### Building out Hex Content

Now, the all that's left for the region is to key each one of the hexes with information! For this part, I recommend using a combination of random tables and your own imagination. There are many resources out there to check out. Knave 2e by Ben Milton is a great resource for worldbuilding, but there are many other great resources as well. I would also suggest checking out Patchwork Paladin's blog. It includes some excellent advice on developing engaging hex content.

#### End Result

The end result will be a hex map consisting of 19 drawn regions in a fully connected campaign setting. There will be 319 sub regional hexes, each keyed with interesting and engaging content. The direction you choose to go and the medium you choose to use is up to you! I prefer digital media (e.g., iPad, Procreate, and Photoshop), but good old fashion paper and Micron markers are good too.

### Final Thoughts
Note that 319 hexes is less than 365. That's just how the math worked out with this flower configuration, but it has the added benefit of being a little more relaxed than "a hex per day for a year." This gives you some breathing room to be thoughtful and take breaks here and there. And if you don't want to take breaks, you can always flesh out the world with dungeons and city maps too! For these, I highly recommend checking out JP Coovert's materials on drawing dungeons and towns (he also has map features as well). It's a very simple style (and one that I've taken to myself because it accommodates my basic level of skill).

We can do this! Let's get to mapping!
