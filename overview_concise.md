### Hexcrawl25 Challenge by Maatlock  

Inspired by Sean McCoy's [Dungeon23](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23), **Hexcrawl25** is a year-long project to create a fully connected campaign setting. The goal: design 19 interconnected regional hexes (divided into 319 sub-hexes) and fill them with creative content, whether through art, worldbuilding, or both.  

You don't need to draw your own maps—use existing resources like [Dyson Logos](https://dysonlogos.blog/2024/12/13/the-autumn-lands-hex-map-e/) if you prefer. The focus is progress, creativity, and finishing!

### Process Summary  

1. **Create the Campaign Grid**  
   - Arrange **19 regional hexes** in a flower pattern
   - Suggested scale: **24 miles per hex** 

2. **Design Regional Features**  
   - Add mountains, forests, roads, and points of interest (e.g., towns, dungeons).  
   - **Drawing is optional**—use premade maps if preferred 

3. **Divide into Sub-Hexes**  
   - Split each regional hex into **19 sub-hexes** overlapping with adjacent regions (6 miles each)

4. **Populate Sub-Hexes**  
   - Key **319 sub-hexes** with content: monsters, NPCs, landmarks, etc 

5. **Avoid Burnout**  
   - Keep detail manageable—high-level notes are enough 
   - **56 days of margin** mean built-in breathing room

### Final Result  

By the end of 2025, you’ll have:  
- **19 regional hexes** (your own art or premade art that you're populating)  
- **319 keyed sub-hexes** filled with engaging content and notated in a journal, three-ring binder, or digital tool
- A **complete campaign setting** to explore and expand!

Whether you draw, journal, or use digital tools, the key is progress. Use random tables, pre-made maps, or your imagination—there’s no wrong way!
